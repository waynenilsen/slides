# Types of Factor Models 

## Time Series Factor Models

- Based on sector and region mostly
- Can be Fama-French style with a value or growth tilt
- Sharpe(92) style analysis is in this category

## Cross-sectional Factor Models

- Usually based on fundamentals.
	- P/E ("value?")
	- Dividend Growth
	- Others?
- BARRA popularized
- Can have many many factors

## Statistical Factor Models

- Let statistics tell you what is driving the market risks
- Orthogonalize the covariance matrix to determine the portfolios which drive risk independently
- Normally results in a fairly parsimonious model

## Hybrid Factor Models

- This is where the other types of factor models are joined together in "stages".
- The residuals from each stage are fed into the next stage.

# Time Series Factor Models

## Definition

- $t \in \mathbb{T} = \{ t_1, \ldots, t_T \}$ - a point in the time mesh
- $R_t (1 \times 1)$ - the return on some stock in our universe of stocks
- $F_t (1 \times D)$ - the return on $D$ factors

## Benifits

- Explain the most variance on average
